## Introduction

This project utilizes Perlin Noise to create detailed and natural-looking terrain patterns, which are then transformed into island shapes. Each generated island features custom elevation mapping and coloration based on the Perlin Noise values.

## Perlin Noise Generation

Perlin Noise is generated by interpolating values from a grid of unit vectors. Each pixel's noise value is calculated based on the contributions from the four surrounding unit vectors and the distance vector.

### Functions Used:

#### Fade Function

The fade function `fade(t)` smooths out the transitions between noise values.

```javascript
const fade = (t) => {
	return t * t * t * (t * (t * 6 - 15) + 10);
};
```

#### Lerp Function

The linear interpolation function lerp(t, a, b) blends values a and b based on the interpolation factor t.

```javascript
const lerp = (t, a, b) => {
	return a + t * (b - a);
};
```

### Terrain Island Generation

The Perlin Noise values are then mapped to custom elevation levels. Islands are shaped using a sinusoidal wave function to create natural-looking terrain features.

### Island Function

I use sum of two different frequency and amplitude sine waves to produce the x-axis wave. Y-axis is just another sine wave with same frequency.

For any pixel in the map by $x$ and $y$ $map_{xy} = map_{xy} \cdot k_{y} \cdot k_{x} $
$k\_{y} = \sin({\pi y }/H)^{2}$ where $H$ is the pixel height.

$k_{x} = \sin({2\pi \cdot x }/W)^{2} + t_{x}\cdot \sin({\pi \cdot x }/W)^{2}$
Where $W$ is the pixel width and $t_{x}$ is the frequency coefficient

If we take $t_{x} = 1$ here is the expected graph on $x$

### Usage

Use pixel number to define a grid size, map will be the same size, and select a layer number to generate more detail.

After the genration you can assign an elevation level to a spesific color.
Also use the island function to create islands.
